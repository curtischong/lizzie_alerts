Pings my phone with new notifications via slack

### Kaggle Kernel Alerter

It's always important for me to keep ontop of the public kernels for competitions I am involved in. So I created this slack bot that pings kaggle's API every 2 hours. if there are new public kernels, the bot will post to a public channel and notify my phone!
